Usage
=============

heightmap2obj [heightmap] [plane scale]

The heightmap can use any image format supported by your .NET framework version, the plane scale is the distance between each converted heightmap pixel on the X and Y axis.

Notes
=============

- This is not ready, nor fully working, and lacks any support for texturing
- Does not optimize object files in any way
- The height scale is taken by the value of red on the colour, divided by two

It's MIT, and designed more as code to learn from, than code to be used in any projects, I don't have any problems with this however.
